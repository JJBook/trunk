/*	pid_t setsid(void);
 *
 *  setsid() creates a new session if the calling process is not a process group leader.  The calling process is the leader of the new session, the
 *  process group leader of the new process group, and has no controlling tty.  The process group ID and session ID of the calling process  are  set
 *  to the PID of the calling process.  The calling process will be the only process in this new process group and in this new session.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *        setsid()  creates a new session if the calling process is not a process group leader.  The calling process is the leader of the new session, the
 *        process group leader of the new process group, and has no controlling tty.  The process group ID and session ID of the calling process  are  set
 *        to the PID of the calling process.  The calling process will be the only process in this new process group and in this new session.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE
 *        The session ID of the calling process.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *        On  error,  -1 is returned, and errno is set.  The only error which can happen is EPERM. It is returned when the process group ID of any process
 *        equals the PID of the calling process. Thus, in particular, setsid() fails if the calling process is already a process group leader.
 *
 * NOTES
 *        A child created via fork(2) inherits its parentâ€™s session ID.  The session ID is preserved across an execve(2).
 *
 *        A process group leader is a process with process group ID equal to its PID. In order to be sure that setsid() will succeed, fork()  and  exit(),
 *        and have the child do setsid().
